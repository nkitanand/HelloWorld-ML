# HelloWorld-ML
An implementation of various Machine Learning classifier models on [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

## Introduction
Using python libraries like scikit libraries which are commonly used for machine learning, this projects trains different models to
classify the Iris flowers based upon it's features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width).

## Libraries Used
1. scipy
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. pandas
5. sklearn

## Machine learning classifier models used 
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
4. Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM).
